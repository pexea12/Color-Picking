# Color-Picking
Color Picking Game (AngularJS)

Author: pexea12 (From UET-VNU)

This game was coded by AngularJS as I started to learn AngularJS. 
It is a simple game. You have to pick the square with the different color.

The high scores part was written by PHP because I don't know how to use AngularJS to work with database.

Enjoy!
